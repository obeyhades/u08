# # Welcome to U08

In this assignment, I chose to fetch my u05 API and create a frontend design for it using Anuglar!


## ðŸš€ How it works

It's very simple to use:

1. Create a user  
2. Log in  
3. Add income, expenses, and saving goals  
4. Start managing your finances!

As a user, you will also be able to edit your profile or delete it if you wish.

##  Note

This project is still in progress, which means it is not fully completed yet.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
